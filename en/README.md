# Learn Cassandra

This book step-by-step guides **developers** to understand what Cassandra is, how Cassandra works and how to use the features and capabilities of Apache Cassandra 2.0.

This book focus more on the develop's view, meaning you will not find too much about installation or administration of Cassandra, which could be another separate big topic for DBAs.
