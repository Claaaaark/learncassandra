# About Cassandra

In this chapter, we will try to summarize what Cassandra can do for you.

Apache Cassandra is a massively scalable open source NoSQL database.

Cassandra is the right choice for managing large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across multiple data centers and the cloud, when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance.

Cassandra delivers continuous availability, linear scalability, and operational simplicity across many commodity servers with no single point of failure.

Cassandra's data model offers the convenience of column indexes with the performance of log-structured updates, strong support for denormalization and materialized views, and powerful built-in caching.
